We’re living in a future where nearly everything we use has been programmed with a mix of underlying hardware and software to bring our current world to life.

We’ve gone from box TV’s that were 8–10 from our couch to smartphones inches away from our face, immersive augmented & virtual reality games. From vintage gassed automobiles to electric-powered Teslas that can detect and prevent an accident faster than any human can.

These things were built by people no smarter than YOU are. But they understand the fundamentals of computer science. They know how to code. In this series, my goal is to teach you how to code, from the ground up.



# Why should you learn to code?

In this series of posts, I’m going to take you through the journey of learning to code by breaking down computer science & programming fundamentals and giving you practical knowledge to build something real.

But why should you learn to code in the first place? Well, if you take a look at the post-pandemic world you’ll notice things are shifting. Industries are rising and falling in desperate need of innovation. Technology is shaping up to be the answer to many of the world’s greatest problems.

Programming skills can allow you to be a part of this shift. With enhanced job opportunities, security, or even be entrepreneurial and create something special. Be ahead of the curve.



# What is Code?

Code is the software that runs on and powers all technology from smartphones apps webpages to military jets and tanks. While coding is the process of writing these applications, detailing a set of instructions and logic that describes what you want to build and need to happen. This then interacts with the desired hardware to give the intended outcome and bring things to life.

In a nutshell, writing code is telling a computer what you want it to do. Think of it as a cooking recipe. A computer has no idea what it has to do, it needs to be taught.

#### Language

Just like we use real human languages to communicate like people. We need to communicate with a computer in a way it can understand. We accomplish this by utilizing computer programming languages.

Most read just like English however their vocabulary is a set of instructions with grammar rules and keywords used to express a task. It then compiles into [binary code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_code) that a computer interprets.

There is an endless amount of computer programming languages. Each with various purposes, differences, and structure. However, the underlying principles remain across the board in the same way sentences are built using subject, object, verb, etc. regardless of language.



# The Art of Programming

Just knowing what code is and how to read the language isn't enough. There's a multitude of things that separates the nubies from the engineers. Being able to write software that works, first and foremost. Writing efficient, clean, and readable code is next. This requires another level of thinking, knowledge, and experience as well. Understanding concepts such as paradigms, operating systems, data structures, and algorithms will put you in a position to be an engineer that creates great software.



# Getting Started

In this series, we’ll create our first program. The language we're going to use through these posts is Python. Why? Python is easy to learn, very high in demand in the marketplace, and versatile. By learning Python first, we're opening vast possibilities as you can branch out into many different fields in the software world.

### Tools

Luckily, it doesn’t take much to get started. Long gone are the days where engineers had to use punchcards to instruct the first computers. Now, all you need is a modern-day computer, laptop or Macbook to get you started.

You will need to tell the computer what to do through a set of text files. Technically this can be through your computer notepad but we’re more advance than that, we’ll be using what is called an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) which is a high-level software edit these text files and much more.

My suggestion for this would be [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It’s free, cross-platform, and powerful. Cannot go wrong here.

#### **Install Python**

The next step here would be to install the actual Python software on your computer. At the time of this article, we're at version 3.8.5. You will want to go ahead and install that or any later version, you can find that [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Follow the simple process and you should have everything needed to run Python on your computer. To check and see if and which version you have installed, open your computer's shell (on Mac OS it's the terminal app). Once you have it open type "python" and hit enter, you should see something like this:

```
admin@admins-mbp ~ % python
Python 3.8.5 (v3.8.5:580fbb018f, Jul 20 2020, 12:11:27) 
[Clang 6.0 (clang-600.0.57)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
```

There you go, you've got python up and running! If you have any troubles the Python documentation is a great [resource](https://www.python.org/doc/), a little research and you can get anything done.

### **Hello World**

Now it's time for our first program! Open Visual Studio Code and create a file called "hello_world.py". Inside it type the following code:

```
print("Hello, World")
```

Save it and go back to your terminal. Change into the directory where your file is and type "python hello_world.py" and this is what you should see:

```
admin@admins-mbp ~ % cd Desktop/PYTHON 
admin@admins-mbp PYTHON % python hello_world.py
Hello, World
admin@admins-mbp PYTHON % 
```

What's happening here is pretty straight forward. We're telling our program to print out the string "Hello, World". From there we're executing that specific file from our terminal window which is instructed to do what our program intended.

There you go! We've successfully made our first program. Although it is very basic everyone starts here. Things will get more complex as we learn more.
